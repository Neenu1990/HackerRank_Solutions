Given the participants' score sheet for your University Sports Day, you are required to find the runner-up score. You are given n scores. Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up.

Input Format:

The first line contains n. The second line contains an array A[] of n integers each separated by a space.

Constraints:

  2<=n <=10
-100 <=A[i] <= 100

Output Format

Print the runner-up score

Sample Input 

5
2 3 6 6 5

Sample Output 

5
Explanation :

Given list is [2,3,6,6,5]. The maximum score is 6, second maximum is 5. Hence, we print as 5 the runner-up score.

Solution

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    A = map(int, input().split()) // code takes list of integers seperated by space
    B = list(set(A))  // convert list A to set to remove duplicate values, store new list in B. 
    B.sort()           // sort the elements in list B.
    print(B[-2])      // returns the second last element in the list B.
